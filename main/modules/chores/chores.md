Chores should have some kind of
repeat frequency set.

Maybe either a day interval,
or a certain date of each month.
Maybe the first Monday, Tuesday, 
etc of each month?

When completing a chore ahead of or behind
schedule, we need to give the option to
the user to either keep the normal next
date, or just go from today. Different
chores will need one of those two options.

Ex 1:

Cleaning the litterbox. If it's daily
and I miss a day or 2, then I want the next
reminder to just be 1 day from when it was 
last completed, not the next day it 
would normally be repeated.

Ex 2:

Bill pay. If I need a reminder on the 15th
of the month, but I don't complete it until
the 20th, I still want the reminder to be
on the 15th of next month.
